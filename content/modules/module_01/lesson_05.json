Now we're going to snap them together to build something cool! Each block you've learned is simple on its own, but when combined, they can create something that feels almost magical.</p><p><strong>What makes a good conversation program?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>It's personal</strong> - Uses the person's name and remembers what they said</li><li><strong>It's engaging</strong> - Asks interesting questions</li><li><strong>It's responsive</strong> - Reacts to what the user tells it</li><li><strong>It's polite</strong> - Greets and says goodbye</li></ol><p>Your program will do all of these things!</p>",
