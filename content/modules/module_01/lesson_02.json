  "title": "Your First Python Playground",
  "estimated_time": "12 minutes",
  "concept": "<p>Before you can speak Python to a computer, you need a place where the computer can listen and respond. Think of it like this:</p><ul><li>If you want to cook, you need a <strong>kitchen</strong></li><li>If you want to paint, you need a <strong>canvas</strong></li><li>If you want to write Python code, you need a <strong>development environment</strong></li></ul><p>Don't let that fancy term scare you! A 'development environment' is just a place where you write code and see what happens when you run it. It's your programming workspace.</p><p><strong>For this course, you have two options:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Use this website's built-in code editor</strong> (the easiest way to start)</li><li><strong>Use a web-based Python playground</strong> like <a href='https://www.python.org/shell/' target='_blank'>Python.org's online shell</a> or <a href='https://replit.com/languages/python3' target='_blank'>Replit</a></li></ol><p>Later, when you're more comfortable, you might want to install Python on your own computer. But for now, let's keep it simple and use the tools that are already available in your web browser.</p><p><strong>Think of it like learning to drive:</strong> You don't buy a car on day one. You use a driving school's car first, then get your own when you're ready. Same idea here!</p>",
  "code_example": {
    "language": "Python",
    "code": "# Let's test that everything is working!\n# This code will perform a few simple tasks\n\n# 1. Display a welcome message\nprint(\"🐍 Welcome to your Python Playground!\")\n\n# 2. Do some simple math\nprint(\"Python can do math: 5 + 3 =\", 5 + 3)\n\n# 3. Display multiple lines\nprint(\"Python can:\")\nprint(\"  - Display text\")\nprint(\"  - Calculate numbers\")\nprint(\"  - And much, much more!\")\n\n# 4. Celebrate!\nprint(\"\\n🎉 Your Python environment is working perfectly!\")",
    "output": "🐍 Welcome to your Python Playground!\nPython can do math: 5 + 3 = 8\nPython can:\n  - Display text\n  - Calculate numbers\n  - And much, much more!\n\n🎉 Your Python environment is working perfectly!"
  },
  "syntax_breakdown": "<p>Let's examine some new things in this code:</p><ul><li><p><strong><code>print(\"text\", 5 + 3)</code></strong> - You can print multiple things in one line! Separate them with commas. Python will display them with a space in between.</p><pre><code>print(\"The answer is\", 42)  # Shows: The answer is 42</code></pre></li><li><p><strong><code>\\n</code></strong> - This is a special code that means 'new line' or 'press Enter'. It's like hitting the Enter key in the middle of your text.</p><pre><code>print(\"Line 1\\nLine 2\")  # Shows two separate lines</code></pre></li><li><p><strong><code>5 + 3</code></strong> - When you write math without quotes, Python actually calculates it! The result (8) gets printed.</p><pre><code>print(5 + 3)     # Shows: 8\nprint(\"5 + 3\")   # Shows: 5 + 3 (just text)</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Emojis</strong> - Yes, Python supports emojis in strings! You can use them just like any other text. They make your output more fun and readable.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The key concept:</strong> Anything inside quotation marks is displayed exactly as written. Anything outside quotes (like <code>5 + 3</code>) is executed as Python code.</p>",
  "exercise": {
    "instructions": "<p><strong>Your Mission:</strong> Create a program that introduces yourself!</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ol><li>Print a welcome message with your name</li><li>Print your favorite hobby or interest</li><li>Use Python to calculate your age in months (your age × 12)</li><li>Print a fun fact about yourself</li></ol><p><strong>Challenge yourself:</strong> Use <code>\\n</code> to add blank lines between sections to make it easier to read!</p>",
    "starter_code": "# Create your introduction program!\n\n# 1. Welcome message\nprint(\"____\")  # Replace with a greeting and your name\n\n# 2. Print a blank line for spacing\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# 3. Your hobby\nprint(\"My favorite hobby is: ____\")  # Fill in your hobby\n\n# 4. Calculate your age in months\n# If you're 25 years old, you'd write: print(\"I am\", 25 * 12, \"months old\")\nprint(\"I am\", ____ * 12, \"months old\")  # Replace ____ with your age\n\n# 5. A fun fact\nprint(\"____\")  # Add any fun fact about yourself!",
    "hint": "<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul><li>For the welcome message, try something like: <code>print(\"Hello! My name is Alex\")</code></li><li>Remember to put text in quotation marks: <code>\"text goes here\"</code></li><li>For math, you DON'T use quotes: <code>25 * 12</code> (not <code>\"25 * 12\"</code>)</li><li>The asterisk (*) means multiplication in Python</li></ul>"

  "solution": {
    "code": "# Create your introduction program!\n\n# 1. Welcome message\nprint(\"👋 Hello! My name is Alex\")\n\n# 2. Print a blank line for spacing\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# 3. Your hobby\nprint(\"My favorite hobby is: reading science fiction books\")\n\n# 4. Calculate age in months\nprint(\"I am\", 25 * 12, \"months old\")\n\n# 5. A fun fact\nprint(\"Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 2 minutes!\")\n\n# Bonus: Add a closing message\nprint(\"\\n🚀 I'm excited to learn Python!\")",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>Breaking down the solution:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>The greeting:</strong> We used an emoji (👋) to make it friendly, followed by the name in quotes.</p></li><li><p><strong>The blank line:</strong> <code>\\n</code> creates a new line, making the output easier to read. You could also just use <code>print()</code> with nothing inside to create a blank line.</p></li><li><p><strong>The hobby:</strong> This is just text in quotes—simple!</p></li><li><p><strong>The age calculation:</strong> We used <code>25 * 12</code> WITHOUT quotes so Python actually does the math. The result (300) gets printed.</p><pre><code>print(\"I am\", 25 * 12, \"months old\")  # Shows: I am 300 months old</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>The fun fact:</strong> More text in quotes. You can write anything!</p></li></ol><p><strong>Your solution will look different</strong> because you used YOUR name, YOUR hobby, YOUR age, and YOUR fun fact. That's perfect! Programming is about making the computer do what YOU want.</p>",
    "common_mistakes": "<h4>⚠️ Common Sticking Points:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Putting math in quotes:</strong></p><pre><code>print(\"25 * 12\")  ❌ Shows: 25 * 12 (just text)\nprint(25 * 12)    ✅ Shows: 300 (calculated)</code></pre><p>If you want Python to calculate, DON'T use quotes!</p></li><li><p><strong>Forgetting commas when printing multiple things:</strong></p><pre><code>print(\"I am\" 25 \"years old\")  ❌ Error!\nprint(\"I am\", 25, \"years old\")  ✅ Correct</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Confusing <code>\\n</code> with <code>/n</code>:</strong></p><pre><code>print(\"/n\")   ❌ Wrong slash - just prints /n\nprint(\"\\n\")  ✅ Correct - creates a new line</code></pre><p>It's a backslash (\\), not a forward slash (/)!</p></li><li><p><strong>Overthinking it:</strong> Your message doesn't have to be perfect or fancy. The goal is to practice using <code>print()</code>, combining text and numbers, and seeing that it works!</p></li></ol><p><strong>Remember:</strong> There's no single \"right answer\" for this exercise—your unique output is the right answer as long as the code runs without errors!</p>"
