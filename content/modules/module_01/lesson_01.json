  "title": "What is Programming, Really?",
  "estimated_time": "10 minutes",
  "concept": "<p>Imagine you're teaching a very literal-minded friend how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You can't just say 'make a sandwich'—you have to break it down into tiny, specific steps:</p><ol><li>Pick up the bread bag</li><li>Open the bag</li><li>Take out two slices of bread</li><li>Place them on the counter</li><li>Pick up the jar of peanut butter</li><li>Twist the lid counter-clockwise to open it</li><li>...and so on</li></ol><p><strong>That's exactly what programming is.</strong></p><p>A computer is like that very literal friend. It's incredibly fast and never gets tired, but it only does <em>exactly</em> what you tell it to do, in <em>exactly</em> the order you tell it. If you forget a step or put them in the wrong order, it won't figure it out—it'll either do the wrong thing or stop and say \"I don't understand.\"</p><p><strong>Python is the language you'll use to give these instructions.</strong> Just like English or Spanish is a language humans use to communicate, Python is a language humans use to communicate with computers.</p><p>The beautiful thing? Python was designed to be as close to plain English as possible, so it reads almost like a recipe or a set of instructions you'd give to a friend.</p>",
  "code_example": {
    "language": "Python",
    "code": "# This is your first Python program!\n# The '#' symbol creates a comment - notes for humans that the computer ignores\n\n# Tell the computer to print (display) a message\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# That's it! This simple instruction tells Python:\n# \"Show the text 'Hello, World!' on the screen\"",
    "output": "Hello, World!"
  },
  "syntax_breakdown": "<p>Let's break down what just happened:</p><ul><li><strong><code>print()</code></strong> - This is a <strong>function</strong> (we'll learn more about these later). Think of it as a command or action word, like 'display' or 'show'. It tells Python: 'take whatever is inside the parentheses and show it to the user.'</li><li><strong><code>(\"Hello, World!\")</code></strong> - The parentheses <code>( )</code> are like a lunchbox—they carry the information that <code>print</code> needs. Inside, we have <code>\"Hello, World!\"</code> wrapped in quotes.</li><li><strong><code>\"Hello, World!\"</code></strong> - The quotation marks tell Python: 'This is text (what programmers call a <strong>string</strong>), not a command.' Without quotes, Python would think <code>Hello</code> is a command and get confused.</li><li><strong><code>#</code></strong> - Everything after a <code>#</code> on a line is a <strong>comment</strong>. Python completely ignores it. Comments are notes you leave for yourself or other programmers to explain what the code does.</li></ul><p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Because if you wrote <code>print(Hello, World!)</code> without quotes, Python would say 'Error! I don't know what Hello is!' The quotes are crucial.</p>",
  "exercise": {
    "instructions": "<p><strong>Your Turn!</strong></p><p>Now it's time to write your own code. In the code editor below, you'll see some starter code with blanks (shown as <code>____</code>).</p><p><strong>Your task:</strong> Replace the blanks to make Python print your own message.</p><ol><li>Replace <code>____</code> with the command that displays text</li><li>Inside the parentheses, write <strong>your own message</strong> (remember the quotes!)</li><li>Click 'Run Code' to see your message appear</li></ol><p><strong>Bonus Challenge:</strong> Add a second <code>print()</code> line to display a second message!</p>",
    "starter_code": "# Welcome to your first Python exercise!\n# Replace the ____ below with the correct code\n\n____(\"Your message here\")\n\n# Bonus: Add another print() line below to display a second message",
    "hint": "<p><strong>Hint:</strong> The command to display text is <code>print</code>. Remember to keep the quotation marks around your message!</p><p>Your code should look like: <code>print(\"Your message here\")</code></p>"
  },
  "solution": {
    "code": "# Welcome to your first Python exercise!\n# Here's the solution!\n\nprint(\"Your message here\")\n\n# Bonus: Here's a second print statement\nprint(\"I'm learning Python!\")\n\n# You could have written ANY message, like:\n# print(\"My name is Alice\")\n# print(\"Python is fun!\")\n# print(\"2025 is my year!\")",
    "explanation": "<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p><ol><li><strong><code>print</code></strong> is the command that tells Python to display something</li><li>The <strong>parentheses ()</strong> contain what you want to display</li><li>The <strong>quotation marks \"\"</strong> tell Python this is text (a string), not code</li><li>You can write ANY text inside the quotes—it's your message!</li></ol><p>For the bonus, you simply added another <code>print()</code> line. Python reads your code from top to bottom, so it displays the first message, then the second.</p>",
    "common_mistakes": "<h4>⚠️ Common Sticking Points:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Forgetting the quotation marks:</strong></p><pre><code>print(Hello)  ❌ Wrong - Python thinks Hello is a variable\nprint(\"Hello\")  ✅ Correct - Python knows this is text</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Misspelling 'print':</strong></p><pre><code>Print(\"Hello\")  ❌ Wrong - capital P\nPRINT(\"Hello\")  ❌ Wrong - all caps\nprint(\"Hello\")  ✅ Correct - lowercase 'print'</code></pre><p>Python is case-sensitive! <code>print</code> and <code>Print</code> are different things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forgetting the parentheses:</strong></p><pre><code>print \"Hello\"  ❌ Wrong in Python 3\nprint(\"Hello\")  ✅ Correct</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Mixing up quote types mid-string:</strong></p><pre><code>print(\"Hello')  ❌ Wrong - starts with \" but ends with '\nprint(\"Hello\")  ✅ Correct - matching quotes\nprint('Hello')  ✅ Also correct - single quotes work too!</code></pre></li></ol><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Both double quotes <code>\"\"</code> and single quotes <code>''</code> work in Python, but you must be consistent within each string!</p>"
