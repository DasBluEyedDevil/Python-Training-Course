  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the correct way to import only the sqrt function from the math module?",
      "options": [
        "import sqrt from math",
        "from math import sqrt",
        "import math.sqrt",
        "from sqrt import math"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "'from math import sqrt' imports only the sqrt function, allowing you to use it directly as sqrt() instead of math.sqrt()."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What does 'import pandas as pd' do?",
      "options": [
        "Imports pandas with error checking",
        "Imports pandas and creates an alias 'pd'",
        "Partially imports pandas",
        "Imports pandas data files"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'as' keyword creates an alias. 'import pandas as pd' lets you use 'pd' instead of 'pandas', a common convention for brevity."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'?",
      "options": [
        "To check if the module name is correct",
        "To run code only when the file is executed directly, not when imported",
        "To validate the main function",
        "To set the module's name"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This allows code to run when the file is executed directly, but not when it's imported as a module. Essential for creating reusable modules with test code."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "When you import a module, what gets executed?",

        "Only class definitions",
        "Nothing until you call a function"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "All top-level code in a module executes when it's imported. This is why we use 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' to prevent test code from running during imports."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What makes a directory a Python package?",

        "Being registered with pip"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A directory becomes a package when it contains an __init__.py file. This file can be empty or contain initialization code."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of __init__.py in a package?",

        "To store configuration settings",
        "To list all files in the package"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "__init__.py marks a directory as a Python package and runs when the package is imported. It can contain initialization code, imports, and define __all__."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "In a package, what does 'from . import module' mean?",

        "Import from all packages",
        "Import everything from module"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The dot (.) refers to the current package. 'from . import module' is a relative import from the same package level."

        "All variables in the module",
        "What gets imported with 'from module import *'",
        "All functions that must be defined",
        "All required dependencies"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "__all__ is a list of strings defining what gets exported when someone uses 'from module import *'. It controls the public API."
    },

        "virtualenv venv",
        "python -m venv venv",
        "python create-venv venv"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "'python -m venv venv' uses Python's built-in venv module to create a virtual environment. The first 'venv' is the module, the second is the directory name."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "multiple_choice",

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of a virtual environment?",
      "options": [
        "To make Python run faster",
        "To isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts",
        "To create virtual machines",
        "To backup your code"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Virtual environments isolate each project's dependencies, preventing version conflicts. Each project can have different package versions without interfering with others."
